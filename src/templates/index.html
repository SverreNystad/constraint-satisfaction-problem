    <p> Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) offer a structured approach to solving puzzles like Sudoku by methodically ensuring that every decision adheres to a predefined set of rules or constraints. In the context of Sudoku, each grid cell represents a variable, and each variable can take on a value from the domain of numbers 1 through 9. The constraints are derived from Sudokuâ€™s rules: each row, column, and predefined 3x3 grid must contain all the numbers 1-9 without repetition. Employing a CSP-solving strategy, such as backtracking, the algorithm assigns values to grid cells (variables) while consistently checking to ensure adherence to the constraints. If a violation is detected, the algorithm backtracks to alter previous choices, iteratively refining its decisions until a solution that satisfies all constraints is found. This methodical, rule-based approach makes CSP a fitting model for elucidating and resolving Sudoku puzzles.</p>
